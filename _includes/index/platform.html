        The Platform
      </h2>
      <p class="text-muted">
        Voluntree is a skill- and knowledge-sharing platform with a difference. Totally transparent,
        directly democratic, and free to use, Voluntree will enable you to help your community, build
        your reputation and learn some brand new skills! Built on a commitment to the idea that
        social exchange has real material value, Voluntree is a social experiment platform that
        challenges the conventional capitalist business structures. Our team and platform
        volunteers have no strict working hours, they choose when and how much they want
        to work, and each have an equal opportunity to contribute to the evolution of the platform.
        The end goal of this project is to find out whether we can create a community-led platform
        where participants are happy to be awarded in oxytocin instead of money and have a full,
        direct and democratic control over their local community budget.
